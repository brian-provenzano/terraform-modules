Webservers (cluster) ASG with ELB module
-----------------------------------------------
-Creates webservers in autoscaling group in multi subnet/AZ with classic ELB
-pass in values located in inputs.tf

NOTE: I like to split out the actual inputs into a separate 'inputs.tf' 
file so you can easily browser/view them.  Just my convention right now...YMMV
