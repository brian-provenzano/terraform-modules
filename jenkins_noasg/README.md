## Simple Module for Creating One Jenkins Master (Exactly)
---
### Creates one jenkins master and no slaves
#### Currently a very simple module for testing etc

TODO: another module that puts each master and slave in sep ASGs, handles doing 'x' slaves (configurable), add EFS (attach at boot to instances in ASG)
Another TODO: or consider dockerizing the slaves??
